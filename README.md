# Course_Recommendation_System
### In this project, I used the Cosine Similarity Machine Learning Algorithm to build a model that recommends courses for a user to take. For the courses, I used the Udemy courses, and the dataset can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/udemy-courses?select=udemy_courses.csv). The steps which were taken to build this model were as follows:
- Convert text to numeric values and perform EDA.
- Calculate the cosine similarity score of the numeric values.
- Perform sorting on the values which have similar similarity scores and recommend the course.

## Results
### After using the Cosine Similarity Machine Learning Algorithm, the result was dataframe containing a course together with its assigned cosine similarity. A sample of the results is shown below:
